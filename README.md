# The Fino Project

This application is an mobile AR game which allows the user to interact with a small dragon character. This character can be taken care of by feeding it or playing with it. In an extended `Play Mode` the player can use markers to spawn random enemies or gems.

## Play Mode
A detailed documentation about the play mode is available <a href="https://github.com/jdmayer/AR_Tamagotchi/blob/main/doc/Documentation%20Playmode.pdf">here on GitHub.</a>
This mode is slightly based on the 1996 Gameboy version of Pokemon, and allows the user to level up the dragon character by interacting with other dragons and gems.

If an enemy dragon is spawned, the player has two option to protect themselves and calm the other dragon down. The first option is a `Joke Attack`. Your character tells a random joke which might calm the enemy down as seen in the following gif.

A part from telling a joke, the user can use the `Tickle Attack` which is executed by performing a tickling motion over the enemie's marker printout.

If the enemy has lost all health points, the fight is won and the opponent has successfully calmed down. With every won fight, your dragon collects experience points which are needed to level up. 
There are three different gems which can be collected: `experience gems`, `health gems`, and `energy gems`. 
In the following gif, a calmed enemy dragon leaves behind an experience gem which gives the player's dragon an additional experience boost.
